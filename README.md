Collection of scripts that implement some algorithms from discrete mathematics.

The primary reason is to help me think about and understand the algorithms.
That is reflected in the style of the algorithms: I try to capture the process of solving the problems with pen and paper,
which means that there often may be simpler and faster solution that utilizes the computer.
